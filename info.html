			<h2>IN 9 OUT OF THE 14 STATES, THERE IS NO EXCEPTION FOR CASES OF RAPE.</h2>

			<h3>Even in the 5 states where exception exists, strict rules make obtaining care extremely difficult:</h3>

			<p>A police report is often required, but two out of three sexual assults are not reported.</p>

			<p>Providers are hesitant to preform abortions for the fear of lawsuits</p>

			<p>Abortion care must be provided before 10 weeks, which is when many rape victims might not releaize they're pregnant</p>

			<p> As a result, the 64,000 people who became pregnant because of rape have little to no abortion options.</p>
			<p> They would have to travel to other states or recvieve abortion by medicine, which is only effective in the first 10 weeks of pregnanct </p>
			<p> Oherwise, survivors might be forced to give birth</p>

          <p>"No other healthcare is reserved only for people who can prove a crime took place. That's not an ethical way to practice "medicine," said Dr.Sami Heywood, a care provider in Illinois</p>
          <p>It is cruel to force people who have already been victimized to jump through legal and logistical barriers that cause further harm</p>
